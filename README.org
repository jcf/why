[[http://localhost:8080/readme.html][*Why*]] do we build software the way that we do, and what can we do with
technology to augment our own intelligence?

*** Let's connect!
We're going to have Emacs evaluate blocks of Clojure code by sending the code to
a running Clojure process via the venerable [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][Cider]].

As the file:datomic directory already contains a working Clojure application
that I've started from inside Emacs we can start evaluating code.

In our ~user.clj~ we make some [[https://github.com/stuartsierra/component][lifecycle]] functions available. In our case we'll
run ~com.stuartsierra.component.user-helpers/reset~ which will refresh all our
code, and then start our nominated system.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(reset)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: :ok

Now we have access to the running system, and everything in it.

*** What's this system all about?
#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
system
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #<SystemMap>

Our system looks rather dull because we've overridden Clojure's ~print-method~
implementation for all ~SystemMap~ records (or the [[https://github.com/stuartsierra/component/blob/9f9653d1d95644e3c30beadf8c8811f86758ea23/src/com/stuartsierra/component.cljc#L183-L191][Component library]] has for
us).

To see what's inside we can put the record into a map like so:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(into {} system)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: '(:config (:datomic (:uri "datomic:mem://why-not"))  :datomic #<Datomic>)

It's a tree of ~pprint-method~ calls all the way down. 🐢

*** Poking at Datomic
Before we migrate anything, before we create anything like a table or start
talking about entities and indices let's poke around at an in-memory Datomic
database to familiarise ourselves a little.

Although we have some convenience functions in our little Datomic codebase we'll
start from first principles (plus or minus a few billion years - hat tip to Mr.
Sagan, and Mr. Feynman).

If you take a look at file:datomic/src/why/datomic/db.clj you'll see we make use
of some ~datomic.api~ functions to create ourselves a database using a URI.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
(d/create-database (str "datomic:mem://" (java.util.UUID/randomUUID)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: true

We just created an in-memory database! From a src block in an Org file entirely
inside Emacs. If your mind isn't blown yet you've not drank enough of the
koolaid.

With the database created (i.e. now that Datomic has set things up for us) we
can open a connection using the idempotent ~datomic.api/connect~.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results pp
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
(let [uri (str "datomic:mem://" (java.util.UUID/randomUUID))]
  (d/create-database uri)
  (repeatedly 5 #(d/connect uri)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (#object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x1563eacc "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@1563eacc"]
:  #object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x1563eacc "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@1563eacc"]
:  #object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x1563eacc "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@1563eacc"]
:  #object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x1563eacc "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@1563eacc"]
:  #object[datomic.peer.LocalConnection 0x1563eacc "datomic.peer.LocalConnection@1563eacc"])
:

Notice that they're all the exact same object. Datomic handles connection
pooling and other complexities for us.

The last thing to point out before we move on is what this mysterious ~db~
function in the examples below is. It takes a system map like the ones we've
seen previously and navigates its way through the maps, keys, and function calls
to ultimately return a database value from a connection to an in-memory
database. Phew!

If you're familiar with the threading macro in Clojure (which you most likely
aren't) this is the path we're ultimately taking with a slight diversion because
we're worried about separation of responsibilities in the codebase.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(-> system :datomic :conn datomic.api/db)
#+END_SRC

*** Queries
"But we don't have any data in the database!" exclaims the unknown student now
rushing ahead. In fact Datomic has already created some novelty for us to
investigate.

Never one to shy away from some code we dive straight into a query!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure :results pp
(sort
 (d/q '[:find [?v ...]
        :where [_ :db/ident ?v]]
      (db system)))
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

#+end_example

So there's a bit to unpick here. We'll start by focusing on the data ignoring
any code for now.

The query in the code above is this little vector filled with keywords, other
vectors, symbols, and more keywords. Lots of Clojure's delightful scalars,
literals, and persistent data structures for us to explore!

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[:find [?v ...]
 :where [_ :db/ident ?v]]
#+END_SRC

But for now all we need do is grok the clauses that come up most frequently. If
we add a little more pomp to our frankly anaemic query we see how things fit
together.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
[:find [?entity ?value]
 :in $ ?arg0 ?arg1 ?arg2
 :where [?entity :some/attribute ?value]]
#+END_SRC

Our query data structure consists of key-value pairs represented in a vector
(for the more learned reader who wonders if an associative form is supported the
answer is yes. Have a red and black cookie).

Knowing that this is an extended for of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog][Datalog]] is handy if you want to read
ahead or research prior art.

Most queries consist of the following three clauses:

- ~:find~ to indicate what data we want back from this query
- ~:in~ to name any parameters this query takes
- ~:where~ to provide clauses of ~[e a v t]~ for unification

Hold up what?! We've not explained unification or what those letters mean!
Unification refers to the fact that anywhere a variable shows up it must have
the same value. Perhaps an example will help:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(def first-name->email-query
  '[:find ?email
    :in $ ?first-name
    :where
    [?e :person/first-name ?first-name]
    [?e :person/email ?email]])
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: #'why.datomic.dev/first-name->email-query

The query above would return **every** email address for anyone with a first
name that matches the first name you provide when executing the query.

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(require '[datomic.api :as d])
(d/q first-name->email-query (db system) "Alice")
#+END_SRC

Notice we passed a database and then a string of ~"Alice"~ to ~datomic.api/q~.
The database value is bound to ~$~ inside our query, and ~"Alice"~ is bound to
~?first-name~.

For more info you can check out Datomic's own [[https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query.html][docs on queries]].

The letters e, a, v, and t you may well have forgotten at this point. Not to
worry. We'll expand on in the next section.

*** TODO Tuple stores (e, a, v, t)
*** TODO Unification
*** TODO A test a day…
We'll add a small test suite to the Datomic codebase to illustrate the value in
the system abstraction, and Datomic's in-memory database.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :dir datomic :results output verbatim

#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Here you can see some exploration powered by Emacs. Unfortunately, both my
battery and my laptop's are running low so it's time to call it a night! We'll
pick up where we left off very soon I hope.

*** Docker delivers
[[https://hasura.io/][Hasura]] and [[https://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]].

We'll run everything in containers with Docker compose.

Make sure you have Docker running. Maybe you don't have it [[https://docs.docker.com/install/][installed]]? Once it is
installed and running you need to install even more code written by people you
probably don't know. Thank you kind internet stranger!

To remain within Emacs as much as possible we want [[https://github.com/Silex/docker.el][docker support]] right here at
our finger tips. Don't forget to [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPO-zST-7EE][stretch those digits!]]

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

#+END_SRC

With all of that lovely code brewing away in the depths of your silicon stallion
you can bring up our GraphQL backend from inside Emacs with a pinky-punishing

~node_modules~.

Now we can start a console with ~hasura console~.
*** hasura console
Somewhere on your dev machine you need to start a Hasura process that will
connect to "INFO console running at" otherwise known as Hasura console.

* Concepts
** The ~user.clj~ convention
There's a special file in Clojure that gets automatically loaded if and when
it's in the right place. This is the [[file:datomic/dev/user.clj][~user.clj~]] file. The simplest tiniest
example of a valid ~user.clj~ file would contain this:

#+BEGIN_SRC clojure
(ns user)
#+END_SRC

Inside this file you can add arbitrary code that will be read and evaluated when
you fire up Clojure using ~clojure~. One thing to bear in mind is that this
namespace will always be loaded so if you break something in there you won't be
able to start a REPL, and without a REPL we are once again mere mortals.
